In this team project, we build a website meant for professors to analyze and consider adjustments to their teaching style using AI. This app has a django backend and react frontend, and utilizes openai's api. Professors upload PDFs of semesterly survey results from their students and can chat with a chatbot to learn what things the students generally appreciated, what things they could do better for next semester, or any number of things!
