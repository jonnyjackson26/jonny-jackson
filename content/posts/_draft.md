Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This post documents how I built my personal developer portfolio using **Hugo**, a blazing fast static site generator, and the awesome **PaperMod** theme. Inspired by [jonny-jackson.com](https://jonny-jackson.com), I wanted a site that was minimalist, fast, and easy to maintain.

## ðŸ–¼ Sample Project Section

I created a `content/projects` section and used custom archetypes to add metadata for each project.

```toml
title = "PlayBoard"
description = "A stats tracker and league management app for basketball players."
repo = "https://github.com/yourname/playboard"
tags = ["react", "firebase", "typescript"]
```
